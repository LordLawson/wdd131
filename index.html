            <p>Nigeria is a country located on the western coast of Africa. It boasts a diverse geography, with climates ranging from arid to humid equatorial. What truly sets Nigeria apart, though, is its people. Hundreds of languages are spoken in the country, including Yoruba, Igbo, Fula, Hausa, Edo, Ibibio, Tiv, and English1. The national capital is Abuja, situated in the Federal Capital Territory, which was established by decree in 1976. While Lagos, the former capital, remains the leading commercial and industrial city in Nigeria.
